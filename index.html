        <h2> part b: quick checks questions </h2>
        <p>q1: after removing the depth, it looks like the sides of the cube are rendering in front of each other. i learned more aobut
            depth testing in <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing"> this link</a>, where it explains that depth testing 
            performs a depth test, if it passes, the fragment is rendered and the depth buffer is updated w/ the new depth value. if it fails, the 
            fragment is discarded
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
            <div class="image-container">
                <small>regular Cube3D.cpp</small>
                <img src="images/gifs/cube3d.gif" alt="cube 3d">

            </div>
            
        </div>
        <p>q2: the update you make to the code is <strong> "if (windowEvent.type == SDL_EVENT_KEY_UP && windowEvent.key.key == SDLK_Q)
        quit = true;"</strong>, this makes it so the window exits when the "Q" key is pressed on our keyboard </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            q3: in the fragment shader in CubeLit.cpp, there is a light direction vector: <strong>"const vec3 lightDir = vec3(0,1,1);"</strong>
            i changed it to <strong>vec3(0, 1, -1)</strong> so that the light direction is below the cube, as displayed below

        <h2>difficulties i encountered</h2>
        <p id="difficulties">
            everything in this homework was really straight forward. because we had used SDL for project 1, setting it up again was nothing hard.
            the hardest part for me was making the triangle scene file. it was similar to what we did for raytracers, but i had to mess around a lot
            with the numbers to render the correct triangle. another hard thing for me was small details such as the headers and moving #define statements 
            into the right spot. i had to mess around with stuff before it stopped having build errors.
            i think already doing key event things in project 1 as well as other classes helped me figure things out pretty quickly. 
            thankful for the easy homework!
